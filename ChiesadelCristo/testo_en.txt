The Church of Christ of the Dominicans stands in the vicinity of the walls of Porta Lecce. It was built in 1232 by the will of Beato Nicolò Paglia, with a Dominican friars convent annexed, used as a school until 2011. Its façade presents a unique point with an alternation of white and red carparo stone and the splendid rosette with sixteen columns. The church presents a single aisle with two Baroque altars on the side, dedicated to Nostra Signora del Rosario and to the Sacro Cuore. The current apse is reduced if compared to the original one. In fact, between the 15th and 16th centuries, the presbytery was demolished for the redefinition of the defensive salient of Porta Lecce.
The wooden sculpture of Nostra Signora della Luce (Lux Mundi) and the wooden crucifix on the main altar (13th century both), represent great examples of fine workmanship.
The Crucifix has been widely venerated throughout Salento. According to a legend, it arrived from Alexandria to Brindisi on a Venetian ship, facing a troubled journey and it managed to reach the port despite the storm. It was decided to expose it in this church only for a short period but, when they attempted to remove it from the altar, where it is still exposed, the task was impossible. The statue seemed to be like nailed to the ground. Only the index finger was removed and it was the only wooden piece brought back to Venice. On the other hand, Nostra Signora della Luce is also known as Our Lady of Pisara, from the heavy stone agricultural tool that, according to legend, was used by the Virgin to punish the outrage of a French soldier.
