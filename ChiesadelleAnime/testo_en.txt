The church dedicated to Saint Sebastian features a sober and elegant façade, framed on the sides by pilasters and crowned by a broken pediment. The portal is surmounted by a similar motif, at the center of which the coat of arms of the city of Brindisi is carved. On either side of the entrance, reached by a staircase, are two niches intended to house sculptures. Along the same axis as the portal opens a lyre-shaped window. The sides of the church follow an irregular layout. Commissioned and financed by the Confraternity of the Souls in Purgatory, the church was completed in 1670 by Archbishop Francesco de Estrada. In the following years, the church underwent significant modifications to the flooring, roof, and entrance staircase. Inside, it still preserves the painting of Saint Januarius Protecting from Earthquakes by Giovanni Scatigno (1747), and the one depicting the Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian by Umberto Colonna (1950).
